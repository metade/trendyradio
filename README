<em>Trendy Radio</em> takes trending topics from <a href="http://www.whatthetrend.com">What the Trend</a> and
uses <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/search/">BBC Search</a> to return relevant BBC radio programmes, tv programmes
and news stories. If it doesn't find any content based on the topic name it uses the 
<a href="http://y.ahoo.it/RPgwQhHM">Yahoo Term Extraction API</a> to pull out the key term from the description 
provided by What the Trend and then uses that to query BBC Search.
